# KiPI — DC power integrity for KiCad 10

[![CI](https://github.com/drewsum/KiPI/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/drewsum/KiPI/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

KiPI is a HyperLynx-PI-style DC drop analyzer that runs as a KiCad 10 IPC plugin:

1. Define voltage regulators (VRMs), loads (current into pins) and DC series elements (beads, resistors, load switches).
2. Simulate voltage drop net by net, across every copper layer, with live solver progress.
3. Inspect voltage, current density, via currents, copper power dissipation and (optionally)
   board temperature in a rotatable 3D view, and write an interactive HTML report.

**Status: 0.6.0 (alpha)** ([changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md)). This entire project was vibe coded with Claude Opus 5.5. I make no assurances that any of this works or is accurate; however, for my use cases (decently complex PCB layouts, windows 11 machine, KiCad 10.0.7), it seems stable. Please leave any comments, concerns or bugs as a github issue. I am used to the Hyperlynx PI workflow and wanted to create a free open source alternative for KiCad, which I think this project accomplishes. I'm open to suggestons for improvements.

## Install

1. In KiCad, enable **Preferences → Plugins → Enable KiCad API**.
2. Link (or copy) this repo into your KiCad plugins folder. KiCad uses your *Documents* folder,
   which may be redirected to OneDrive on Windows machines:

   ```powershell
   $plug = "$([Environment]::GetFolderPath('MyDocuments'))\KiCad\10.0\plugins"
   New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path "$plug\KiPI" -Target "<path to this repo>"
   ```

3. Restart the PCB editor. KiCad builds the plugin venv in the background; the first time this
   downloads PySide6 and VTK, so give it a few minutes. The **KiPI** toolbar button appears
   once the venv is ready. If it never appears, right-click the action in
   *Preferences → Plugins* and choose *Recreate Plugin Environment*.

## Using KiPI

### 1. Open the board

Open your board in the PCB editor and click the **KiPI** toolbar button. KiPI opens in its
own window and reads the board through the KiCad API; the log at the bottom streams each
stage as it runs.

* **Refill zones** (toolbar, on by default) refills every zone in KiCad before reading, so
  the zone fills KiPI sees match your current routing. KiPI analyzes filled copper only.
* **Load from KiCad** re-reads the board after you edit it, and reloads the saved PI setup
  (save first if you have unsaved changes).
* **Save snapshot… / Open snapshot…** store the extracted board as a file that KiPI can open
  later without KiCad.

### 2. Pick the nets

The **Board** panel on the left lists every net. Tick the nets you want to analyze: they are
drawn in 3D and offered in the PI setup pin pickers. **Power & ground only** filters the
list, **All power** ticks every likely power and ground net, and **None** clears it. Type in
the filter box to find a net.

Below that:

* **Copper layers** toggles layers in the view.
* **Display** colors copper by layer or by net, exaggerates the stackup (**Z scale**), shows
  or hides vias, pads and the board, and cuts the view along X, Y or Z (**Cut**, slider,
  **Flip**) to look inside the stackup.
* **Info** shows whatever you last clicked in 3D. **Select in KiCad** selects that pad or
  via in the PCB editor.

Toolbar buttons set **Top / Bottom / Iso** views and save a **Screenshot…**. Drag to rotate,
scroll to zoom and shift-drag (or middle-drag) to pan.

### 3. Model the power system

The **PI setup** panel on the right holds the power tree. KiPI infers nothing from the board,
so every entry comes from you. Each list has **Add**, **Duplicate** and **Remove** buttons.
Pins are chosen with a picker: pick the net, then the part (type to search), then optionally
the pin numbers (e.g. `1,2,5`; blank means all of that part's pins on the net). Problems such
as missing pins, or two VRMs on one group, are shown in red as you edit.

**VRMs tab**: one entry per regulator or supply.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Type | **Source** (ideal supply), **LDO** (I_in = I_out + I_q) or **Switcher** (P_in = P_out / efficiency) |
| Output pins, Set voltage | Where it drives, and to what voltage |
| Input pins | LDO and switcher only. The pins it draws from, which ties this VRM to its upstream net and defines the power tree. |
| Efficiency / Quiescent | Switcher efficiency, LDO quiescent current |
| Sense pins | Optional remote sense: the VRM regulates the voltage at these pins instead of at its output |
| Ground pins | Optional: also solve the ground return, so the drop is measured output-to-ground |
| Ground sense pins | Optional negative remote sense on the ground net: the VRM holds its set voltage relative to these pins instead of 0 V (needs ground pins) |
| Phases | Parallel phases of a multi-phase regulator. **Edit phase** picks which phase the output, input and ground pins belong to. |

**Multi-phase VRMs**: set **Phases** above 1, then choose each phase in **Edit phase** and
give it its own output pins (e.g. its inductor), input pins and ground pins. A new phase
starts as a copy of the previous one, so change its part. All phases share the VRM's set
voltage, type, efficiency and sense pins. Each phase carries an equal share of the output
current and settles at whatever voltage its copper needs to deliver that share. The VRM
regulates its sense pins or, without them, the average of its phase outputs. Each phase draws
its own input current and returns its own ground current. The VRMs results tab lists every
phase under its VRM.

To try it without a design of your own, open the example board in
[`examples/multiphase_buck`](examples/multiphase_buck): a 4-phase 12 V → 0.9 V, 40 A core rail
(`python -m kipi --snapshot examples/multiphase_buck/multiphase_buck.kipi.json.gz`).

**Loads tab**: one entry per consumer.

* **Supply pins** and **Current**. With several supply pins, **Current split** chooses
  between splitting the current evenly over all pins and giving explicit **pin groups**,
  each with its own current (**Add pin group**, or **One group per pin**). Use groups when one
  part draws different currents on different rails or pins, e.g. a core and an I/O supply.
* **Ground pins** (optional) include the ground return.
* **Max drop** (%) is the PASS/FAIL limit. Each load is judged by its worst pin.

| Loads tab | Thermal tab |
|---|---|
| ![Load editor](docs/images/setup_loads.png) | ![Thermal settings](docs/images/setup_thermal.png) |

**DC connections tab**: parts that pass DC from one net to another, such as sense
resistors, ferrite beads, fuses, load switches and 0 Ω links. Give **Side A pins**,
**Side B pins** and a **Resistance**. Nets joined this way are solved together as one group,
and each group may hold only one VRM. A net with no connection to its VRM is reported, not
guessed at.

**Mesh tab**: **Max edge** is the largest triangle edge in mm; smaller is more accurate and
slower. **Via grading** controls how fast the mesh refines towards plated holes, and
**Barrel plating** sets the via wall thickness. The defaults suit most boards.

**Copper tab**: **Resistivity** at 20 °C, by default annealed copper (1.724 µΩ·cm), applies to
every layer and to via barrel plating. **TCR** is the temperature coefficient that the
electro-thermal co-simulation uses (0.00393 /°C for copper). The table lists each copper layer.
Give a layer its own resistivity to override the default, for example for electroplated or
rolled-annealed foil. Leave it at **default** to use the value above. Layer thicknesses come
from the KiCad board stackup. **Thickness unit** shows them in µm, mil or oz (1 oz = 35 µm).

**Thermal tab** (off by default): tick **Electro-thermal co-simulation** to make losses heat
the board and the warmer copper become more resistive. Set:

* **Ambient** temperature.
* **Iterations**: three is usually enough. The Notes tab shows how much each iteration
  changed.
* **Airflow** in m/s.
* **Grid**, the thermal cell size: *auto* gives about 250 cells across the board.
* **Laminate k**: *from stackup* looks up the in-plane conductivity from each dielectric's
  material in your KiCad stackup (FR4, prepreg types, polyimide, Kapton, PTFE, Rogers,
  ceramic, aluminum…). Unrecognized names fall back to FR4 with a warning. Enter a value
  here to override.

The setup is saved as `<board>.kipi-setup.json` next to the board when you click **Save** at
the top of the panel and every time you solve. It travels with the project and can go into
version control.

### 4. Solve

Click **Solve all**. Every net group is meshed and solved, the downstream loads first and then
back towards the source, so each VRM's input current includes everything it feeds. Progress
and solver residuals stream into the log; **Cancel** stops the run.

Tick **HTML report** before solving to also write `<board>_kipi_report.html` next to the
board, and **Report** opens it afterwards. It is a single file that works offline, containing:

* the summary and every results table;
* an interactive 3D view per net group (rotate, zoom, hover for values);
* per-layer statistics, with top-down voltage and current-density maps;
* the board temperature map when thermal is on.

| Summary tables | Interactive 3D per net group |
|---|---|
| ![Report summary tables](docs/images/report_tables.png) | ![Report 3D voltage view](docs/images/report_3d.png) |

### 5. Read the results

In the **Results** group, choose a **net group** and a **field** to show in 3D:

* **Voltage**
* **Current density**. Tick **Arrows** to see where and which way the current flows.
* **Power density**
* **Via current**
* **Temperature** (with thermal on)

Voltages are measured against the source's ground pins (0 V). When ground returns are
solved, the ground under a load rises above 0 V, so a supply plane can read above its VRM's set
point even though a remotely sensed rail is exactly on target. The Loads tab's effective
voltage (supply minus ground at the load) is the figure to compare with the set point.

Click any point on the copper or any via to probe it. **Show copper** returns to the plain
geometry view without any results.

![Voltage across the +3.3V plane, with the Loads results table](docs/images/voltage.png)

![Current density with flow arrows on the 5 A +12Vin input path](docs/images/current_density.png)

| Via current | Temperature |
|---|---|
| ![Via current, with the Vias table ranked by current](docs/images/via_current.png) | ![Board temperature from the electro-thermal solve, with the Notes tab](docs/images/temperature.png) |

Result tabs:

| Tab | Shows |
|---|---|
| Loads | Each load's current, effective voltage, drop, worst pin and PASS/FAIL. Double-click to show its group. |
| VRMs | Output and input voltage, current and power, plus conversion loss, with a row per phase for multi-phase VRMs |
| DC connections | Current and loss in each series part |
| Vias | Every via and PTH barrel ranked by current. Set a **Current limit** for PASS/FAIL, and double-click a row to fly to it. |
| Losses | Copper loss per group and layer, vias, DC connections and VRM conversion |
| Notes | Solver details, warnings and the thermal iteration history |

**Export ▾** writes the tables as CSV, the 3D results as a ParaView `.vtm`, or **Save
results…** as a `.kipi-results` file, which the toolbar's **Open results…** reloads without
solving again. Results files are Python pickles, so only open ones you created.

### Tips and troubleshooting

* **"No copper path" between a VRM and a load** usually means unrouted copper, an unfilled
  zone, or a missing DC connection for a series part between them.
* **Unexpected drop:** compare the board view with KiCad. Thermal reliefs, necked traces and
  via counts dominate DC drop, and the Current density view with Arrows makes the bottleneck
  obvious.
* **Slow solves:** raise **Max edge**, or analyze fewer nets at a time. Large planes are cheap
  but very fine traces are not.
* **Logs:** each session writes to `%TEMP%\kipi\kipi-<date>-<time>-<pid>.log`, and the last
  15 sessions are kept. A matching `.crash.log` collects native crash tracebacks and, if a
  task runs longer than a minute, a stack dump of every thread. Attach both to bug reports.

## Development

KiPI also runs outside KiCad, against the running PCB editor or a saved snapshot:

```powershell
python -m venv --system-site-packages .venv   # use KiCad's bundled python.exe
.venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
.venv\Scripts\python -m kipi                         # connect to the running PCB editor
.venv\Scripts\python -m kipi --dump board.kipi.json.gz   # extract only
.venv\Scripts\python -m kipi --snapshot tests\data\synthetic.kipi.json
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest tests
.venv\Scripts\ruff check .                    # lint, as CI does (ruff check . --fix fixes most)
```

`requirements.txt` is what KiCad installs into the plugin's venv; test and lint tools live
only in `requirements-dev.txt`.

CI runs ruff and the test suite on Windows and Linux for every push and pull request. The
tests also solve the example board and check that its committed setup still matches
`make_board.py`. After changing the generator, rerun
`python examples/multiphase_buck/make_board.py` and commit both output files.
